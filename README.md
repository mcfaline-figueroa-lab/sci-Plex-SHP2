# sci-Plex-SHP2
This repo contains the code used for single-cell RNA-seq analysis in the sci-Plex-SHP2 study in which we examine the relationship between structural perturbations to SHP2 and
the effect on gene expression. The folders in the repository contain analysis scripts, including files used for preprocessing, analysis, and interpretation. 

### Contents

##### Data and data processing scripts
The data presented in our manuscript are derived from 2 single-cell screens. All raw and processed files can be found on the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Ominibus (NCBI GEO) repository under series GSE____. The pipeline to demultiplex sci-Plex-v2 experiments beginning with .fastq files can be found in the [process\_from_raw](https://github.com/mcfaline-figueroa-lab/sci-Plex-EGFRi/tree/main/process_from_raw) folder of the mcfaline-figueroa-lab/sci-Plex-EGFRi repo.
